                    Conan Doyle. The film's screenplay was written by Michele Mulroney and Kieran Mulroney. Robert
                    Downey
                    Jr. and Jude Law reprised their roles as Holmes and Watson, respectively, alongside Noomi Rapace as
                    Simza, Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes, Jared Harris as Professor Moriarty, and Rachel McAdams as
                    Irene
                    Adler. Although the film follows an original premise, it incorporates more closely elements of Conan
                    Doyle's short stories, including "The Final Problem" (1893) and "The Adventure of the Empty House"
                    (1903).[5] In the film, Holmes and Watson travel across Europe with a Romani adventuress to foil an
                    intricate plot by their cunning nemesis, Professor Moriarty, to instigate a major European conflict.

                Captain
                America, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the
                sequel
                to
                Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), and the 13th
                film
                in
                the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo from a screenplay by
                the
                writing team of Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, and stars Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain
                America

                Holland,

                oversight of the Avengers fractures the team into two opposing factions—one led by Steve Rogers and the
                other by
                Tony Stark (Downey).
                <br><br><b>Plot</b><br>
                Friction arises between the Avengers when one group supports the government's decision to implement a
                law to
                control their powers while the other opposes it.
