        <h2 id="sh1">Background</h2>
        <p>Robert John Downey Jr. is an American actor and producer. His career has been characterized by critical and
            popular success in his youth, followed by a period of substance abuse and legal troubles, before a

        <h3>Personal Life</h3>
        <p>
            Downey was born in Manhattan, New York City, the younger of two children. His father, Robert Downey Sr., was
            an
            actor and filmmaker, while his mother, Elsie Ann (née Ford), was an actress who appeared in Downey Sr.'s
            films. Downey's father was of half Lithuanian Jewish, one-quarter Hungarian Jewish, and
            one-quarter Irish descent, while Downey's mother had Scottish, German, and
            Swiss ancestry.
            Robert's original family name was Elias which was changed by his father to enlist in the Army. Downey and
            his older sister Allyson grew up in Greenwich Village.<sup>[14]</sup> <br><br>

            As a child, Downey was "surrounded by drugs." His father, a drug addict, allowed Downey to use marijuana at
            age
            six, an incident which his father later said he regretted.<sup>[14]</sup> Downey later stated that drug use
            became an
            emotional bond between him and his father: "When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him
            trying to
            express his love for me in the only way he knew how." Eventually, Downey began spending every night abusing
            alcohol and "making a thousand phone calls in pursuit of drugs".<sup>[15]</sup><sup>[16]</sup> <br><br>

            During his childhood, Downey had minor roles in his father's films. He made his acting debut at the age of
            five,
            playing a sick puppy in the absurdist comedy Pound (1970), and then at seven appeared in the surrealist
            Western
            Greaser's Palace (1972).<sup>[11]</sup> At the age of 10, he was living in England and studied classical
            ballet
            as part of
            a larger curriculum.<sup>[17]</sup><sup>[18]</sup> He attended the Stagedoor Manor Performing Arts Training
            Center in upstate New York
            as a teenager. When his parents divorced in 1978, Downey moved to California with his father, but in 1982,
            he
            dropped out of Santa Monica High School, and moved back to New York to pursue an acting career full-time.
            <br><br>

            Downey started dating actress Sarah Jessica Parker in 1984 after meeting her on the set of Firstborn. The
            couple
            later separated in 1991 due to his drug addiction.<sup>[124]</sup><br><br>

            He married actress and singer Deborah Falconer on May 29, 1992, after a 42-day courtship.<sup>[125]</sup>
            Their son,
            Indio
            Falconer Downey, was born in September 1993.<sup>[126]</sup> The strain on their marriage from Downey's
            repeated trips
            to
            rehab and jail finally reached a breaking point; in 2001, in the midst of Downey's last arrest and
            sentencing to
            an extended stay in rehab, Falconer left Downey and took their son with her.<sup>[125]</sup> Downey and
            Falconer
            finalized
            their divorce on April 26, 2004.<br><br>

            Downey with wife Susan Downey at the 2010 Academy Awards
            In 2003, Downey met producer Susan Downey (née Levin), an Executive Vice President of Production at Joel
            Silver's film company, Silver Pictures on the set of Gothika.<sup>[4]</sup> Though Susan twice turned down
            his amorous
            advances, she and Downey did quietly strike up a romance during production.<sup>[127]</sup> Despite Susan's
            worries
            that
            the romance would not last after the completion of shooting because "he's an actor; I have a real
            job",<sup>[127]</sup>
            the
            couple's relationship continued after production wrapped on Gothika, and Downey proposed to Susan on the
            night
            before her thirtieth birthday.<sup>[127]</sup> In August 2005, the couple were married, in a Jewish
            ceremony, at
            Amagansett, New York.<sup>[128]</sup><sup>[129]</sup> A tattoo on one of his biceps reads "Suzie Q" in
            tribute to her.<sup>[130]</sup> The
            Downeys’ first child, a son named Exton Elias, was born in February 2012,<sup>[131]</sup> and their second,
            a daughter
            named Avri Roel, was born in November 2014.

        <h3>Career</h3>
        <p>Downey Jr. made his debut as an actor at the age of five in the film Pound (1970), written and directed by
            his
            father, Robert Downey Sr.. He built his film repertoire throughout the 1980s and 1990s with roles in Tuff
            Turf
            (1985), Weird Science (1985), True Believer (1989), and Wonder Boys (2000) among many others. In 1992,
            Downey
            received an Academy Award nomination and won the BAFTA (British Academy Award) for Best Actor for his
            performance in the title role of Chaplin (1992).<br><br>

            In Robert Altman's Short Cuts (1993), he appeared as an aspiring film make-up artist whose best friend
            commits
            murder. In Oliver Stone's Natural Born Killers (1994), with Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis, Downey
            starred
            as a tabloid TV journalist who exploits a murderous couple's killing spree to boost his ratings. For the
            comedy
            Heart and Souls (1993), Downey starred as a young man with a special relationship with four ghosts. In 1995,
            Downey starred in Restoration (1995), with Hugh Grant, Meg Ryan and Ian McKellen, directed by Michael
            Hoffman.
            Also that year, he starred in Richard III (1995), in which he appears opposite his Restoration (1995)
            co-star
            McKellen.<br><br>

            In 1997, Downey was seen in Robert Altman's The Gingerbread Man (1998), alongside Kenneth Branagh, Daryl
            Hannah
            and Embeth Davidtz; in One Night Stand (1997), directed by Mike Figgis and starring Wesley Snipes and
            Nastassja
            Kinski; and in Hugo Pool (1997), directed by his father, Robert Downey Sr. and starring Sean Penn and
            Patrick

            along with Ben Stiller, Elijah Wood, Gaby Hoffmann, Brooke Shields and Claudia Schiffer. In January of 1999,
            he
            starred with Annette Bening and Aidan Quinn in In Dreams (1999), directed by Neil Jordan.<br><br>

            In 2000, Downey co-starred with Michael Douglas and Tobey Maguire in Wonder Boys (2000), directed by Curtis
            Hanson. In this dramatic comedy, Downey played the role of a bisexual literary agent. In 2001, Downey made
            his
            prime-time television debut when he joined the cast of the Fox-TV series Ally McBeal (1997) as attorney
            "Larry
            Paul". For this role, he won the Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in
            a
            Series, Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television, as well as the Screen Actors Guild Award for
            Outstanding Performance by a Male in a Comedy Series. In addition, Downey was nominated for an Emmy for
            Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.<br><br>

            The actor's drug-related problems escalated from 1996 to 2001, leading to arrests, rehab visits and
            incarcerations, and he was eventually fired from Ally McBeal (1997). Emerging clean and sober in 2003,
            Downey
            Jr. began to rebuild his career.<br><br>

            He marked his debut into music with his debut album, titled "The Futurist", on the Sony Classics Label on
            November 23rd, 2004. The album's eight original songs, that Downey wrote, and his two musical numbers
            debuting
            as cover songs revealed his sultry singing voice and his musical talents. Downey displayed his versatility
            in
            two different films in October 2003: the musical/drama The Singing Detective (2003), a remake of the BBC hit
            of
            the same name, and the thriller Gothika (2003) starring Halle Berry and Penélope Cruz. Downey starred in
            powerful yet humbling roles inspired by real-life accounts of some of history's most precious kept secrets,
            including Richard Linklater's A Scanner Darkly (2006) in 2006 co-starring Keanu Reeves, Winona Ryder and
            Woody
            Harrelson, and Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus (2006) co-starring Nicole Kidman, a film inspired
            by
            the life of Diane Arbus, the revered photographer whose images captured attention in the early 1960s. These
            roles exhibited Downey's momentum from the previous year of 2005, in which he starred in the Academy
            Award®-nominated feature film Good Night, and Good Luck. (2005), directed by George Clooney and in Shane
            Black's
            action comedy Kiss Kiss Bang Bang (2005) co-starring Val Kilmer. In 2007, he co-starred in David Fincher's
            suspenseful Zodiac (2007), alongside Jake Gyllenhaal and Mark Ruffalo, about the notorious serial killer who
            haunted San Francisco during the 1970s.<br><br>

            In May 2008, Downey achieved critical acclaim and worldwide box office success for his starring role in Iron
            Man
            (2008), Jon Favreau's big-screen rendering of the Marvel comic book superhero. The film co-starred Gwyneth
            Paltrow, Jeff Bridges and Terrence Howard. In August of 2008, Downey starred with Ben Stiller and Jack Black
            in
            the comedy Tropic Thunder (2008), and went on to receive an Academy Award®-nomination for Best Supporting
            Actor
            for his, Kirk Lazarus.<br><br>

            In December 2009, Downey starred in the action-adventure Sherlock Holmes (2009). The film, directed by Guy
            Ritchie, co-starred Jude Law and Rachel McAdams and earned Downey a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an
            Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical in January of 2010. In early Summer 2010, Downey re-teamed
            with
            director Jon Favreau and reprised his role as "Tony Stark/Iron Man" in the hugely successful sequel to the
            original film, Iron Man 2 (2010), starring Gwyneth Paltrow, Scarlett Johansson, Samuel L. Jackson and Mickey
            Rourke.<br><br>

            Downey next starred in Due Date (2010), a comedy directed by Todd Phillips, in which he plays the role of an
            expectant father on a road trip racing to get back in time for the birth of his first child. Due Date
            (2010),
            starring The Hangover (2009)'s Zach Galifianakis, was released in November 2010.<br><br>

            Downey was honored by Time Magazine's "Time 100" in 2008, an annual list of the 100 most influential people
            in
            the world. His laurels include two Academy Award nominations, three Golden Globe wins, numerous other award
            nominations and wins, and tremendous popular and commercial success, particularly in his roles as Sherlock
            Holmes and Tony Stark (the latter of which he has so far played in Iron Man (2008), Iron Man 2 (2010), The
            Avengers (2012), Iron Man 3 (2013), and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). For three consecutive years, from
            2012
            to 2015, Downey has topped the Forbes list of Hollywood's highest-paid actors, making an estimated $80
            million
            in earnings between June 2014 and June 2015.</p>
